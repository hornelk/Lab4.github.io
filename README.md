# Project Name: Proportional Circle Map of Wine Produced by each US State

## Brief Introduction
This web map was created as my fourth lab for GHY4818: Web Mapping, taught by Dr. Johnathan Sugg at Appalachian State University. The topic of US wine production was chosen as I developed a fascination and love for wine while working as a somelier. As a wine geographer, I thought it would be interesting to visualize exactly how much wine is produced around the country. Obviously we would expect California to dwarf all other productions, and that is the case for this map. However, some might be surprised by the amount of wine coming out of states like New York, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. These are states that are not often associated with fine wines.

## Major Functions
